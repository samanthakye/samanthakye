  <h1>How Pinterest Was Made</h1>

  <h2>What I Learned</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>At first they just used Python and MySQL.</li>
    <li>They added caching with Memcache and Redis to make the site faster.</li>
    <li>As more people joined, they used more servers and split their databases.</li>
    <li>Now it’s way bigger: they have microservices, data pipelines with Kafka, and they keep everything in the cloud (AWS).</li>
    <li>The front end (what we see) is built with React, which makes the pin grid smooth.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>HTML</h2>
  - Uses a grid of “cards” (each pin = image + text + links).
  - Semantic elements for layout (header, main feed, footer).
  - each pin uses <img> tag for photos
  - A description or title (inside <p> or <span>).

  <h2>CSS</h2>
  - columns and rows but unaligned and slightly scattered
  - changes sizes based on device
  - White card backgrounds
  - rounded corners border-radius
  - drop shadows box-shadow


  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  - Infinite scrolling
  - Interactive buttons and features when hovering over images
  - dynamically changing content
  - fade in
